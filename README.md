# DataStructuresProject
This project implements scheduling algorithms using priority queues to optimize process allocation and minimize makespan. It develops data structures for processors and jobs, a max-priority queue, and compares a greedy approach with a greedy-decreasing strategy using Quicksort. Experimental evaluation is conducted using randomized input data.
